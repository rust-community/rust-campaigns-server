# Rust Campaigns Server

This is intended for teams in the Rust Project to setup calls to action and outreach advertising campaigns to be displayed in the Rust Web network. This application takes some inspiration from the [Perl Community Ad Server](http://pcas.szabgab.com/)

The campaigns will not be commercial. We don't accept money for displaying these campaigns across the Web sites.

The content of the ads could be:

- Calls to action and/or participation from different projects in the ecosystem (probably automatically imported from TWiR)
- Events
- Surveys

Initially, we just want to serve simple campaigns. There will not be any tracking, targetting, scheduling, frequency management, custom sizing, categorization or reporting initially. All of this could be implemented in the future.
